"# GDC-app" 
This is the start of my readme for the gdc app I am looking to create for my final project from my coding course.

Initial functionality I am hoping to achieve is:
    - Ability to login with username and password
    - Ability to submit games for suggestions for the month in different categories
    - A list of visible played games from previous meetings with rankings
    - A random game picker for each category

Funcionality I would also like to add once this core functionality is working:
    - Personal ratings, and an aggregated rating from the app
    - Ability to create personal notes on app, which will be saved within your account
        -If possible, the ability to share mini reviews on played games in a dropdown menu from people who have played
    - A slideshow carousel of images from previous meetings
    - Description of preivious meetings selectable by date
    - A time-place section for next meetings

This will be a PERN stack app, so will be using Node.js for the front-end, Express for the data handling, and PostgreSQL for the back-end database.
